# 🛡 Event Monitoring Audit (E.M.A)

## Windows Security Log Monitoring – Failed Logon Analysis (Event ID 4625)

---

###  Why I Took On This Project
I wanted to put myself in the shoes of a SOC analyst and ask:  
**“What would I do if I saw repeated failed logins on a Windows system?”**

This project is my way of showing how I approach problems — collecting data, analyzing patterns, and thinking critically about whether something is harmless user error or the start of a security incident.

###  Tools I Worked With
- **Windows Event Viewer** → to capture and filter logs  
- **PowerShell** → to export logs for deeper analysis  
- **Excel / CSV** → to parse and report on events  
- **Splunk** → to visualize failed logon attempts and correlate activity  
- *(Future Work)* ELK Stack integration for broader SIEM coverage  

Each tool played a role in helping me move from raw data to meaningful insights.

###  What I Found in the Logs
- **Event ID:** 4625 (Failed Logon)  
- **Failure Reason:** Invalid credentials (`0xC000006D`, `0xC0000380`)  
- **Process:** `svchost.exe` (legitimate, but worth monitoring)  
- **Source Address:** Redacted for security  
- **Impact:** Multiple failures in a short timeframe can mean brute-force or password spraying attempts.  

At first glance, these look like simple login mistakes. But when they pile up, they tell a different story.

### Splunk Dashboards
I wanted to go beyond text logs and make the data **visual and easy to interpret**. Splunk helped me build dashboards that highlight suspicious activity.
